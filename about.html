        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Hi, I'm Nathan Cote, a Computer Science student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I have a passion for programming, game development, and problem-solving. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to learn new technologies and improve my skills.</p>
            <p>Outside of coding, I have 8 years of experience playing the viola and am currenlty (poorly) learning the guitar. I also have a third degree black belt in karate and love staying active through sports like ski racing, soccer, and tennis. As a member of the Alpine Ski team at WPI, I hope to better my skiing abilities in the coming years.</p>
